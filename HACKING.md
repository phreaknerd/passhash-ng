# Developing passhash-ng

To start developing features/fixes for passhash-ng clone this repository
and hack away. Once things are ready for testing do this:

* go to about:debugging in your firefox
* enable "Enable add-on debugging"
* click on "Load Temporary Add-on"
* pick any file from your passhash-ng source tree

This will load your current passhash-ng from disk as an extension.
